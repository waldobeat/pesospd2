const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Actually, I can use the existing firebase config and run it via a simple node script if I had the credentials.
// But I can also just do it in the next useEffect of the app one time.
// Since I can't easily run a privileged firestore script without credentials, 
// I'll add a temporary "Migration" effect in App.tsx that runs once.

  Migration Logic to be added to App.tsx:
  - Get all messages where chatId is missing.
  - For each, set chatId.
